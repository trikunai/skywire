## Introduction
This article represents the central source of information for the ongoing Skywire testnet. All information about rewards and potential changes will be published here, so check in regularely.

* Read this information thoroughly and ask in the [Skywire](https://t.me/skywire) telegram channel if some things appear to not be covered. 
* Please join [SkywirePSA](https://t.me/SkywirePSA) as well to get structured public service announcements (PSA) about the Skywire project & testnet.
* In case you just bought an official Skyminer on the [hardware store](https://store.skycoin.net/) please read [this article](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/wiki/Official-Skyminer-Welcoming) if you haven't done that already. 

***

## Rules
This section covers the rules of the testnet. Dependent on the amount of miners that are associated with your emails, some of these rules may apply to you or not.

As of now, each person participating in the Skywire testnet may own one DIY miner and multiple official Skyminers. 
<div align="center"><b>"A DIY miner cannot be in the same location as another DIY or official Skyminer.</b></div><br>

Based on this central rule, each whitelisted person is eligible for receiving rewards for:
* one or multiple official miners 

*and/or*

* one DIY miner with up to 8 (eight) nodes

<div align="center"><b>You must use the <a href="https://whitelist.skycoin.net">Skywire Whitelisting System</a> to keep your submitted data up to date</b>
<br><em> Read<a href="https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/wiki/Skywire-Whitelisting-System"> this guide</a> to familiarize yourself with the new system.</em></div>
<br>
Different locations are required due to the fact that we want to spread out the meshnet and not create built-up areas. This prevents paying people to simply run single board computers (SBC) and to require them to provide a service to the network.

* If you are running two separate miners in the same location because you're joining the network living in the same house you still have to move one of your miners to another location. 

<div align="center"><em>Submitting miners under multiple email addresses is illegal and very likely to be detected - measures will be taken if such actions are recognized.</em></div>

***

## Rewards
<br>

* Eligible for rewards are only the whitelisted nodes, that **comply with the Skywire testnet rules** and **meet the 75% uptime requirement** during the month.
* The whitelist is being **updated retroactively on a monthly basis** so it is **not important** in which week you are being approved for the whitelist.
* **Official Skyminers are whitelisted by default after purchase.**
* The rewards are **paid every month around the 5th** or with a short delay, depending if other things delay the process.

<br> 
<h3>Official Skyminers </h3>

There are two different reward categories for official miners:
* official Skyminers first & second batch - **not sold through** the hardware store 
* official Skyminers new batches - **sold through** the [hardware store](https://store.skycoin.net)

<em>Faulty orange pi prime's of official Skyminers will be rewarded regardless of your uptime until you receive a replacement. If the replacement doesn't arrive in time for you to make the uptime requirement because it arrived on short notice or not on the schedule at all you will be rewarded as well. Since we are taking care of this manually you are requested to contact one of our team members on telegram (@Paperstream @asxtree) or at support@skycoin.net</em>

<h4>Official Skyminers -  First & Second Batch</h4>
<div align="center"><em><u>We are currently revising the reward strucure for our early supporters. Details of the rewards going forward will be announced very soon. </u></em></div><br/>

The reward structure for January will remain the same as in December.
Rewards are being paid on a node by node basis. The total amount of rewards is limited by a pool size that is subject to change. The pool size for December was 24,000 Skycoin:
* You can receive a maximum of 12 Skycoin per node
* Rewards are being calculated on a node by node basis
* The total pool size is being divided evenly between all nodes eligible for receiving rewards. This implies that you will receive less than 12 Skycoin per-node rewards in case the pool size would be surpassed. 

The official reward pool size for January was 24,000 Skycoin:
* **9.49 Skycoin / node ; 75.92 Skycoin per 8 node official Skyminer**
</div>
<br>

<h4>Official Skyminers - New Batches</h4>

<div align="center">
<em><u>Fixed Skycoin payments can be claimed within three years after purchase.</u></em><br/><br/>
You will receive a fixed Skycoin payment per month <b>in addition</b> to any traffic forwarding payments <br/> that you will receive in the Skywire mainnet.<br/><strong>
Fixed Skycoin payments per month = USD Miner Price / 24 = $83.30 USD.</strong></div>
<br/>
<div align="center"><i>Your fixed Skycoin payments are dependent on your the uptime of your nodes. All of your 8 nodes must meet the uptime requirement for you to receive the full $83.30 USD, it is therefore <strong>superimportant to keep your nodes online.</strong></i></div>

Summary:
* You are eligible to receive 24 fixed Skycoin payments ($83.30 USD)
* The 24 fixed Skycoin payments are comprised of 8 Skycoin node payments ($10.4125 USD)
* You'll receive up to 8 Skycoin node payments per month based on the individual uptime of your nodes 
* The uptime of all nodes in your official Skyminer is being evaluated on a node by node basis
* *You will receive traffic forwarding payments once the Skywire mainnet is live*


<h3>DIY Skyminers</h3>

Rewards are being paid on a node by node basis. The total amount of rewards is limited by a pool size that is subject to change. The DIY pool size for January was 16,000 Skycoin:
* **2.867 Skycoin / node with a maximum of 8 nodes; 22.937 Skycoin maximum**
* As soon as the total amount of rewards of all eligible nodes would be surpassed the pool size, we will adjust the rewards as follows: 
	* The Skycoin in the pool will be evenly split up between all nodes which are eligible for rewards. 
	* The maximum amount of Skycoin that any node can receive is 6 (six) Skycoin.

## Rewards Requirement

<div align="center"><b>Each node must have at least 75% uptime during the month to be eligible for rewards.</b></div> 

As of now, you are provided with two tools to check whether or not you're online and generating uptime:
* The [discovery website](http://discovery.skycoin.net:8001/)
* The [node checker tool](https://skywirenc.com/)

You are advised to use this guide to **verify that your nodes are online & connected to the discovery server**:[https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/wiki/How-to-verify-that-your-nodes-are-online](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/wiki/How-to-verify-that-your-nodes-are-online)

<div align="center"><em><b>Make sure to verify the online status of your nodes on a regular basis!</em></b></div>
